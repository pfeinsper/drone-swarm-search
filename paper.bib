  abstract = {In maritime search and rescue (SAR), the planning of the search path will directly affect the efficiency of searching for people overboard in the search area. However, traditional SAR decision-making schemes often adopt a fixed search path planning mode, but the limits are poor flexibility, low efficiency, and insufficient intelligence. This paper plans a search path with the shortest time-consuming and priority coverage of high-probability areas, considering complete coverage of maritime SAR areas and avoiding maritime obstacles. Firstly, a maritime SAR environment model is built using marine environmental field data and electronic charts. Secondly, an autonomous coverage path planning model for maritime SAR is proposed based on reinforcement learning, in which a reward function with multiple constraints is designed to guide the navigation action of the vessel agent. In the iterative training process of the path planning model, the random action selection probability is dynamically adjusted by the nonlinear action selection policy to ensure the stable convergence of the model. Finally, the experimental verification is conducted in different small-scale maritime SAR simulation scenarios. The results indicate that the search path can cover the high-probability areas preferentially with lower repeated coverage and shorter path length compared with other path planning algorithms.}

  abstract = {The prevalence of maritime transportation and operations is increasing, leading to a gradual increase in drowning accidents at sea. In the context of maritime search and rescue (SAR), it is essential to develop effective search plans to improve the survival probability of persons-in-water (PIWs). However, conventional SAR search plans typically use predetermined patterns to ensure complete coverage of the search area, disregarding the varying probabilities associated with the PIW distribution. To address this issue, this study has proposed a maritime SAR vessel coverage path planning framework (SARCPPF) suitable for multiple PIWs. This framework comprises three modules, namely, drift trajectory prediction, the establishment of a multilevel search area environment model, and coverage search. First, sea area-scale drift trajectory prediction models were employed using the random particle simulation method to forecast drift trajectories. A hierarchical probability environment map model was established to guide the SAR of multiple SAR units. Subsequently, we integrated deep reinforcement learning with a reward function that encompasses multiple variables to guide the navigation behavior of ship agents. We developed a coverage path planning algorithm aimed at maximizing the success rates within a limited timeframe. The experimental results have demonstrated that our model enables vessel agents to prioritize high-probability regions while avoiding repeated coverage.}

  abstract = {Drowning events are becoming more common. It is important to accurately predict the drift trajectory of floating objects. This study proposes a sea-area-scale drift modeling method to determine the drift trajectory of persons-in-water in offshore China. The proposed method divided offshore China into 18 areas, and field experiments were carried out in the northern East China Sea (N_ES) and the Taiwan Strait (TS). First, a series of models were created, namely N_ES_I (N_ES upright), N_ES_II (N_ES facedown), TS_I (TS upright), TS_II (TS facedown), C_I (comprehensive upright), and C_II (comprehensive facedown). The leeway coefficients and jibing frequencies were then determined, and the positive crosswind speed (+CWL) probabilities under different marine environments were analyzed. A large volume of information from open-source channels was used to establish a database of historical drift cases. The driven model was validated using a combination of field experiments and historical drift information. The results indicate that the trajectories simulated using the sea-area-scale models proposed in this study are more consistent with the actual trajectories than those using the constant coefficients. The prediction areas are sensitive to the +CWL probability and the jibing frequencies. This study can help to improve the ability of the drift trajectory in China.}
