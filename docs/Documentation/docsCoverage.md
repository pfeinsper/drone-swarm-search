# Drone Swarm Search: The Coverage Environment

## About

The **Coverage Environment** is our second training environment, building on the `PettingZoo` framework and accommodating both multi-agent and single-agent setups with reinforcement learning algorithms. In contrast to the Search Environment, which aims to locate survivors, the Coverage Environment focuses on efficiently maximizing the search spread over the most probable area in minimal time. This environment differs from the Search Environment in its static nature; it employs a Lagrangian particle model that integrates real tidal data to accurately represent the area of highest probability. This simulation utilizes the open-source library [Opendrift](https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift). Below, you can find a visual representation of the environment. To explore the environment without an algorithm, execute the script `basic_coverage.py`.

- **`render_mode`**:

    - **`ansi`**: This mode presents no visualization and is intended to train the reinforcement learning algorithm.
    - **`human`**: This mode presents a visualization of the drones actively searching the target, as well as the visualization of the person moving according to the input vector. 

- **`render_grid`**: If set to **True** along with `render_mode = "human"`, the visualization will be rendered with a grid. If set to **False**, there will be no grid when rendering.

- **`render_gradient`**: If set to **True** along with `render_mode = "human"`, the colors in the visualization will be interpolated according to the probability of the cell. Otherwise, the color of the cell will be solid according to the following values, considering the values of the matrix are normalized between 0 and 1: `1 > value >= 0.75` the cell will be <span style="color:lightgreen; text-shadow: -0.8px 0 black, 0 0.8px black, 0.8px 0 black, 0 -0.8px black;">green</span> | `0.75 > value >= 0.25` the cell will be <span style="color:#FFD700; text-shadow: -0.8px 0 black, 0 0.8px black, 0.8px 0 black, 0 -0.8px black;">yellow</span> | `0.25 > value` the cell will be <span style="color:red; text-shadow: -0.8px 0 black, 0 0.8px black, 0.8px 0 black, 0 -0.8px black;">red</span>.

- **`timestep_limit`**: It's an integer that defines the length of an episode. This means that the `timestep_limit` is essentially the number of steps that can be done without resetting or ending the environment.

- **`disaster_position`**: **(float, float)** parameter to specify the location of the event that let to PIW (Persons In Water), it receives a `tuple` of floats, representing the **latitue** and **longitute** of said location. default value is (-24.04, -46.17), a point near the coast of Guaruja, Brazil.

- **`drone_amount`**: Specifies the number of drones to be used in the simulation. This **integer** parameter can be adjusted to simulate scenarios with different drone counts.

- **`drone_speed`**: An **integer** parameter that sets the drones' speed in the simulation, measured in meters per second `(m/s)`. Adjust this value to simulate drones operating at various speeds.

- **`drone_probability_of_detection`**: This **float** parameter signifies the probability of a drone detecting an object of interest. Changing this value allows the user to simulate different detection probabilities.

- **`pre_render_time`**: This **int** parameter specifies the amount of time `(hours)` to pre-render the simulation before starting. Adjusting this value lets the user control the pre-rendering time of the simulation.

- **`prob_matrix_path`**: This **string** parameter allows the user to specify the path to file of a already simulated probability matrix. The file should be a `.npy` file containing a probability matrix. If this parameter is not specified, the environment will generate a new probability matrix.

## Built in Functions

### `env.reset`:

The `env.reset()` reinitializes the environment to its initial state. To customize the starting conditions, such as drone positions, you can pass an `options` dictionary to the method. Hereâ€™s how to structure this dictionary and use the `reset()` method:

```python
opt = {
    "drones_positions": [(10, 5), (10, 10)],
}
observations, info = env.reset(options=opt)
```
#### Parameters in the options Dictionary:

- **`drones_positions`**: Specifies the initial `[(x, y), (x, y), ...]` coordinates for each drone. Ensure this list **contains** an entry for each drone in the environment.

#### Default Behavior:

Without any arguments, `env.reset()` will place drones sequentially from left to right in adjacent cells. When there are no more available cells in a row, it moves to the next row and continues from left to right.

#### Return Values:

The method returns an `observations` dictionary containing observations for all drones, which provides insights into the environment's state immediately after the reset. The `info` dictionary contains additional information about the environment.

### `env.step`:

The `env.step()` method defines the drone's next movement. It requires a dictionary input where each key is a drone's name and its corresponding value is the action to be taken. For instance, in an environment initialized with 10 drones, the method call would look like this:

```python
env.step({
    'drone0': 2, 'drone1': 3, 'drone2': 2, 'drone3': 5, 'drone4': 1,
    'drone5': 0, 'drone6': 2, 'drone7': 5, 'drone8': 0, 'drone9': 1
})
```

::: warning Warning
Every drone listed in the dictionary `must` have an associated action. If any drone is omitted or if an action is not specified for a drone, the method will raise an **error**.
:::

#### The method returns a tuple containing the following elements in order:

- **`Observation`**: The new state of the environment after the step.
- **`Reward`**: The immediate reward obtained after the action.
- **`Termination`**: Indicates whether the episode has ended (e.g., find all castway, limit exceeded).
- **`Truncation`**: Indicates whether the episode was truncated (e.g., through a timeout).
- **`Info`**: A dictionary containing auxiliary diagnostic information.

### Probability Matrix

The probability matrix is created using a Lagrangian particle simulation facilitated by the [Opendrift library](https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift). In this process, particles are released at a disaster site and drift with water currents. Those reaching the coast are removed from the simulation. The matrix is constructed by recording the number of particles that reach each grid cell, thus encapsulating the data accumulated throughout the simulation. The final locations of these particles are documented to form the matrix.

    <em>Fig 2: Opendrift simulation over 40 hours, starting at coordinates (-24.04, -46.17).</em>
</p>

As demonstrated in the above GIF, after conducting the Opendrift simulation, we ascertain the final positions of the particles and proceed to construct the probability matrix. This matrix is visually represented by the blue particles in the image below.

    <br>
    <em>Fig 3: Final positions of particles from an Opendrift simulation.</em>
</p>

Following the collection of particle data, we generate the probability matrix. Each cell in this matrix represents the likelihood of discovering a person at that particular location, as depicted in the subsequent image.

    <em>Fig 4: Final probability matrix.</em>
</p>

- **`Probability Matrix`**: The probability indicated in each cell reflects the likelihood of finding a person in that specific location.

### Observation

The observation is a dictionary with all the drones as keys, identified by names such as `drone0`, `drone1`, etc. Each key is associated with a tuple that contains the drone's current position and its perception of the environment, represented as a probability matrix.

- **Tuple Structure**: `((x_position, y_position), probability_matrix)`
  - **`x_position`**, **`y_position`**: The current coordinates of the drone on the grid.
  - **`probability_matrix`**: A matrix representing the drone's view of the probability distribution of the target's location across the grid. 

An output example can be seen below.

    'drone0': 
        ((5, 5), array([[0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],

    'droneN':

                                        [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],

        ),
        
}
```

### Reward

The reward returns a dictionary with the drones names as keys and their respectful rewards as values. For example `{'drone0': 1, 'drone1': 89.0, 'drone2': 1}`

The rewards values goes as follows:

- **`Default Action`**: Every action receives a baseline reward of `0`.
- **`Leaving the Grid`**: A penalty of `-10` is applied if a drone leaves the grid boundaries.
- **`Exceeding Time Limit`**: A penalty of `-100` is imposed if the drone does not locate all the cells before the timestep_limit is exceeded.
- **`Collision`**: If drones collide, each involved drone receives a penalty of `-10`.
- **`Searching a Cell`**: The reward for searching a cell is proportional to the probability p of the cell being searched, denoted as `10 + (1 / (timestep)) * prob_matrix * 1_000`.
- **`complete the serching`**: If all cells are searched, the reward is `100`.

### Termination & Truncation

The termination and truncation variables return a dictionary with all drones as keys and boolean as values. By default, these values are set to `False` and will switch to `True` under any of the following conditions:

- **`Collision`**: If two or more drones collide.
- **`Time Limit Exceeded`**: If the simulation's timestep exceeds the `timestep_limit`.

#### For example, the dictionary might look like this:

```python
{'drone0': False, 'drone1': False, 'drone2': False}
```

### Info

The `Info` is structured as a dictionary of dictionaries, where each drone, such as `drone0`, serves as a key. The associated value is another dictionary containing several key metrics:

- **`is_completed`**: a boolean indicating whether the drone has searched all grid cells. It starts as False and changes to True once the drone has completed its search.
- **`coverage_rate`**: the percentage of the grid that has been covered by the drone.
- **`repeated_coverage`**: the percentage of the grid that has been covered more than once, indicating overlap in search areas.
- **`accumulated_pos`**: The accumulated Probability of Sucess (POS) of the SAR mission, this serves as a way to quantify the chance of finding all SAR targets within a mission.

The `info` section serves as an indicator of the progress of the search operation.

For example, here is how the dictionary appears before any drone has completed its search:

```python
{'drone0': {'is_completed': False, 'coverage_rate': 0.5693877551020409, 'repeated_coverage': 0.0010204081632653062, 'acumulated_pos': 0}}
```

After a drone successfully locates the person, the dictionary updates to reflect this:

```python
{'drone0': {'is_completed': True, 'coverage_rate': 100, 'repeated_coverage': 2.912397984939490308, 'acumulated_pos': 1.0}}
```

This setup allows users to continuously monitor and assess the effectiveness of the search operation during the simulation.

### `env.get_agents`:

The `env.get_agents()` method will return a list of all the possible agents (drones) currently initialized in the simulation, you can use it to confirm that all the drones exist in the environment. For example, in an environment configured with 10 drones, the method would return:

```python
['drone0', 'drone1', 'drone2', 'drone3', 'drone4', 'drone5', 'drone6', 'drone7', 'drone8', 'drone9']
```

### `env.save_matrix`:

The `env.save_matrix()` method enables saving the probability matrix as a `.npy` file. To use this method, you must provide a string parameter that specifies the file path where the matrix should be saved. For example:

```python
env.save_matrix("path/to/save/matrix.npy")
```

After saving, you can load this matrix in a newly created environment using the `prob_matrix_path` parameter:

```python
env = CoverageDroneSwarmSearch(
    drone_amount=3,
    render_mode="human",
    disaster_position=(-24.04, -46.17),  # (lat, long)
    pre_render_time=10, # hours to simulate
    prob_matrix_path="path/to/save/matrix.npy"
)
```

::: warning Warning
Ensure that the `disaster_position` and `pre_render_time` parameters are the same as those used to generate the matrix to maintain consistency in the simulation conditions.
:::

::: tip Tip
The `env.save_matrix()` method is not only convenient for saving the probability matrix post-simulation but also essential for reusing it in subsequent simulations without needing to regenerate it. It facilitates varying simulation parameters, such as the number of drones, their speed, or timestep, for different experimental setups.
:::

### `env.close`:

`env.close()` will simply close the render window. Not a necessary function but may be used.
